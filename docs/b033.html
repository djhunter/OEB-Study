The visions he saw about Samaria and Jerusalem. </p><h6>The Lord’s Judgment on Guilty Samaria and Judah</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v033001002" id="001002" >2</span>
 Listen, all you peoples! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Pay attention, all you inhabitants of the earth! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For the Lord  <span class="nd"> God </span>  will be a witness against you, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; the Lord from his holy temple! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v033001003" id="001003" >3</span>
 The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  is coming from his holy place, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; he descends and treads on the heights of the earth, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v033001004" id="001004" >4</span>
 so that the mountains melt beneath <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; like wax in the presence of the fire, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and the valleys break apart <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; like water poured down a steep descent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v033001005" id="001005" >5</span>
 All this is because of the crime of Jacob, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and for the sin of the house of Israel. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; What was the crime of Jacob? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Was it not Samaria? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the sin of Judah? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it not Jerusalem? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v033001006" id="001006" >6</span>
 “I will make Samaria a ruin in an open field, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and a place where a vineyard is planted, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; I will hurl down her stones into the valley, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and lay bare her foundations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v033001007" id="001007" >7</span>
 “All her images will be shattered, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and all her statues will be burned with fire, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and all her idols I will lay in ruins. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For they were acquired by prostitution, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and to prostitution they will return.” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v033001008" id="001008" >8</span>
 This is why I will mourn and wail, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; I will go barefoot and naked, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; I will howl like the jackals <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and mourn like the desert owl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v033001009" id="001009" >9</span>
 For the blow that Samaria has received is incurable. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; It has spread over Judah, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; it extends even to the gate of my people, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; even to Jerusalem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v033001010" id="001010" >10</span>
 Don’t tell this in Gath! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Don’t even cry – but sit in the dust at Beth-leaphrah. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v033001011" id="001011" >11</span>
 Pass by, inhabitants of Shaphir, naked and ashamed! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The inhabitants of Zaanan cannot leave their city. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Beth-ezel laments and removes its support from you. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v033001012" id="001012" >12</span>
 The inhabitants of Maroth wait anxiously for good! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; But the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  has sent disaster to the gates of Jerusalem. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v033001013" id="001013" >13</span>
 Harness the horse to the chariot, inhabitants of Lachish. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; You led the daughter of Zion, Jerusalem, into sin, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; in you are found the crimes of Israel. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v033001014" id="001014" >14</span>
 Therefore you must give parting gifts to Moresheth-gath. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Beth-achzib will betray the kings of Israel. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v033001015" id="001015" >15</span>
 I will hand you to a conqueror, people of Mareshah, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; the leaders of Israel will hide in Adullam Cave! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v033001016" id="001016" >16</span>
 Shave your head in morning for the children you love, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; until you are bald as vultures, because they have left you for exile. </p><h6>The Oppression of the Poor</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="chapter" id="002001">2</span> Woe to those who lie awake planning evil, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; who in the light of morning carry out their plan <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; because they have the power to do it. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v033002002" id="002002" >2</span>
 They covet fields and seize them, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; desire houses and take them, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; they crush householder and his household, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; people and their possessions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v033002003" id="002003" >3</span>
 Therefore the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  says: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; “I am planning disaster from which you cannot save your neck, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; nor walk proudly because it will be a terrible time. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v033002004" id="002004" >4</span>
 On that day they will sing a taunt-song to you, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; this mocking lament: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; ‘My people’s estate is being measured for sale, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; our captors are dividing our fields. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; We are completely undone.’ <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v033002005" id="002005" >5</span>
 There will be no one to measure out land for you <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; from the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span> ’s community. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v033002006" id="002006" >6</span>
 “‘Don’t rant!’ they urge, ‘Of such things one does not prophesy! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Shame will not overtake us! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v033002007" id="002007" >7</span>
 Is the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  impatient, or are such things his deeds? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Are not his words favorable to the family of Jacob?’ <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Aren’t my commands good for those who obey them? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v033002008" id="002008" >8</span>
 But you, you stand up as a foe against those who are peaceful; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; you strip the robe from those who pass by quietly, averse to conflict. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v033002009" id="002009" >9</span>
 Women of my people you drive out from their happy homes, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; from their young children you take away my glory forever. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v033002010" id="002010" >10</span>
 Rise and begone, for this is no place to rest. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Your uncleanness brings destruction, severe destruction. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v033002011" id="002011" >11</span>
 If a person walking in wine and falsehood were to say, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; ‘I will prophesy to you of wine and strong drink,’ <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; then he would be the perfect prophet for this people!” </p><h6>The Lord Leading Back His Scattered People</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v033002012" id="002012" >12</span>
 “I will assuredly assemble all of Jacob, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; I will surely gather the survivors of Israel. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; I will herd them together as sheep in a fold, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; like a flock in the pasture, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and the land will resound with the sounds of multitudes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v033002013" id="002013" >13</span>
 “The one who breaks out goes first. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; They have broken forth and passed by the gate <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and through it have they gone out. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Their king leads before them, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  at their head.” </p><h6>The Crimes of Judah’s Civil and Spiritual Leaders</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="chapter" id="003001">3</span> I also said: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; “Listen now, leaders of Jacob, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; judges of the house of Israel. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it not your duty to know what is the right? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v033003002" id="003002" >2</span>
 Haters of that which is good and lovers of evil! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v033003003" id="003003" >3</span>
 “They devour the flesh of my people, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and their hide they strip from off them, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and break in pieces and serve up their bones, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; like meat in a pot or the cooking-pan! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v033003004" id="003004" >4</span>
 “Then they will cry out to the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; but he will not pay attention to them. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; He will hide his face from them at that time <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; because they have committed such crimes.” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v033003005" id="003005" >5</span>
 Therefore the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  says: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; “To the prophets who lead my people astray, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; who when they have food between their teeth declare peace, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; but against one who puts nothing in their mouths, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; they proclaim an open war! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v033003006" id="003006" >6</span>
 “Night will overtake you so that you have no vision, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and darkness so that there will be no divination, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and the sun will go down on the prophets, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and the day shall be dark over them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v033003007" id="003007" >7</span>
 “The seers will be ashamed, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and the diviners will turn pale, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; all of them will cover their mouths. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For there will be no answer from God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v033003008" id="003008" >8</span>
 “But I, on the contrary am full of power, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and the sense of justice and strength, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; to make known to Jacob his crime, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and to Israel his sin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v033003009" id="003009" >9</span>
 “Hear this, leaders of the house of Jacob, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; judges of the house of Israel, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; you who spurn justice. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and make all that is straight crooked, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v033003010" id="003010" >10</span>
 who build Zion with acts of bloodshed, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and Jerusalem with crime. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v033003011" id="003011" >11</span>
 “The leaders render judgment for a bribe, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and her priests give oracles for a reward, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and her prophets divine for silver. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet they claim to rely on the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; ‘The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span> ’, they say, ‘is in our midst. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Evil cannot overtake us.’ <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v033003012" id="003012" >12</span>
 “Therefore for your sakes <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Zion will be plowed as a field, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and Jerusalem will become a heap of ruins, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and the temple mount a wooded height.” </p><h6>The Peace and World-wide Renown of Zion</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="chapter" id="004001">4</span> In the days to come <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; the mountain of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  will be established, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; the house of our God on the top of the mountain, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; lifted above the hills. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; All the nations will flow to it, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v033004002" id="004002" >2</span>
 and many peoples will go and say, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; “Come, let us go up to the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span> ’s mount, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; to the house of the God of Jacob, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; so that he may instruct us in his ways, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; so that we may walk in his paths.” <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For from Zion proceeds instruction <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span> ’s word from Jerusalem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v033004003" id="004003" >3</span>
 He will arbitrate between many peoples, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and render decisions for numerous nations, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; They will beat their swords into ploughshares, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and their spears into pruning hooks. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Nation will not lift up sword against nation, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; they will learn war no more. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v033004004" id="004004" >4</span>
 They will live each under his vine, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and under his fig-tree, with none to terrify them. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For the mouth of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  of hosts has spoken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v033004005" id="004005" >5</span>
 Each nation trusts in the names of their gods, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; but we will worship the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  our God forever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v033004006" id="004006" >6</span>
 “On that day,” says the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; “I will assemble the lame. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; I will gather exiles I punished. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v033004007" id="004007" >7</span>
 I will restore the lame as a remnant, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; the exiles into a great nation. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  will rule over them <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; on Mount Zion from that time forever.” <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v033004008" id="004008" >8</span>
 But you, watchtower for the flock, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; hill of the daughter of Zion, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; to you will return your former rule. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v033004009" id="004009" >9</span>
 So why do you now cry aloud? Haven’t you any king? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Or has your counselor perished, so you writhe in pain like a woman in labor? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v033004010" id="004010" >10</span>
 Writhe and scream, daughter of Zion, like a woman in labor! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For now you must leave the city and camp in the open field. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; You will be taken to Babylon, but there will be rescued. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; There the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  will save you from the hands of your foes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v033004011" id="004011" >11</span>
 But now many nations gather against you. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; They say, “Let her be defiled, we will gloat over Zion.” <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v033004012" id="004012" >12</span>
 But they do not know the thoughts of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; They do not understand his plan, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; for he has gathered them like sheaves for the threshing floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v033004013" id="004013" >13</span>
 “Arise, thresh, daughter of Zion. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; I will make your horns iron, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and your hoofs brass, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; so you might beat in pieces many peoples, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and devote to the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  their spoil, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and their wealth to the ruler of all the earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="chapter" id="005001">5</span> “Now cut yourself in bitter grief, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; daughter besieged by soldiers. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; They have set a wall around you. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; They strike the ruler of Israel, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; in the face with a rod. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v033005002" id="005002" >2</span>
 “Bethlehem in Ephrathah, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; small among the tribes of Judah, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; from you will come a king <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; who will rule for me over Israel, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; whose family line goes back to the distant past.” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v033005003" id="005003" >3</span>
 So the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  will only abandon Israel to its enemies <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; until the woman in labor gives birth. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the survivors will be reunited with their own people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v033005004" id="005004" >4</span>
 And he will stand and shepherd by the strength of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; In the exalted name of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  his God; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And they will live in security, for now he will be great, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; even to the ends of the earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v033005005" id="005005" >5</span>
 This will be our peace: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; when Assyria comes into our land <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and treads on our soil, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; we will raise up against him seven shepherds, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; eight leaders of men. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v033005006" id="005006" >6</span>
 They will shepherd Assyria with a sword, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and the land of Nimrod with bared blades. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; They will deliver us from Assyria, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; when they come into our land, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and tread within our borders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v033005007" id="005007" >7</span>
 And the survivors of Jacob will be disbursed among the nations, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; in the midst of many peoples <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; like dew from the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; like showers on the grass, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; which don’t wait for people to come <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; or linger for mortals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v033005008" id="005008" >8</span>
 And the survivors of Jacob will be disbursed among the nations. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; in the midst of many peoples, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; like a lion among the beasts of the forest, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; like a young lion among the sheep-folds, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; who, when he passes through, pounces. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; He savages his prey. There is no rescuer. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v033005009" id="005009" >9</span>
 Let your hand triumph over your adversaries, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; let all your enemies be cut off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v033005010" id="005010" >10</span>
 On that day, says the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; “I will slaughter your horses from your midst, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and destroy your chariots. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v033005011" id="005011" >11</span>
 I will devastate the cities in your land, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and tear down your fortresses. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
