<span class="verse" rel="v029001002" id="001002" >2</span>
 Hear this, elders, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pay attention, all inhabitants of the land, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Has anything like this happened in your days, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or in the days of your ancestors? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v029001003" id="001003" >3</span>
 Recount it to your children; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; let your children tell it to their children, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and their children to the generation that follows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v029001004" id="001004" >4</span>
 That which the cutting locust has left, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the swarming locust has eaten, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; that which the swarming locust has left, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the hopping locust has eaten, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and that which the hopping locust has left, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the destroying locust has eaten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v029001005" id="001005" >5</span>
 Awake, drunkards, and weep, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and wail, all drinkers of wine; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the new wine is cut off from your mouth. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v029001006" id="001006" >6</span>
 For a nation has come up on my land, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; powerful, and numberless; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; its teeth are the teeth of a lion, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and its jaw-teeth are like those of a lioness. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v029001007" id="001007" >7</span>
 It has laid waste my vines, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and barked my fig-tree; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; it has peeled and cast it away, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bleached are the branches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v029001008" id="001008" >8</span>
 Wail as a bride, clad in sack-cloth, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for the husband of her youth. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v029001009" id="001009" >9</span>
 Cut off are the cereal and drink-offerings <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from the house of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; in mourning are the priests, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; who minister at the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span> ’s altar. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v029001010" id="001010" >10</span>
 The fields are blasted, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the land is in mourning, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; for ruined is the grain, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the new wine fails <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the oil is dried up. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v029001011" id="001011" >11</span>
 Be dismayed, farmers; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wail, vine-dressers. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For the wheat and the barley; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for the harvest is lost from the fields. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v029001012" id="001012" >12</span>
 The vine fails to bear fruit, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the fig-tree is drooping; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; the pomegranate, palm, and apple, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all the trees of the field are dried up. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The people’s joy withers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v029001013" id="001013" >13</span>
 Put on sackcloth, and beat your breasts, priests; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wail, ministers of the altar; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; come, lie all night in sack-cloth, ministers of God; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; for cereal-offering and drink-offering <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are cut off from the house of your God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v029001014" id="001014" >14</span>
 Sanctify a fast, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; summon an assembly, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; gather the elders and all the inhabitants of the land <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; into the house of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  your God, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; cry to the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v029001015" id="001015" >15</span>
 Alas for the day! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Near at hand is the day of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and as destruction from the Almighty it comes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v029001016" id="001016" >16</span>
 Is not food cut off <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from before us, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; gladness and joy <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from the house of our God? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v029001017" id="001017" >17</span>
 The grains shrivel under their hoes, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the storehouses are desolate, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the barns broken down, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for the grain is withered. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v029001018" id="001018" >18</span>
 How the herds of cattle bellow in distress, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for they have no pasture! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The flocks of sheep are forlorn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v029001019" id="001019" >19</span>
 To you, the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, I cry. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For fire has devoured <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the pastures of the wilderness, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and flame has scorched <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all the trees of the field. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v029001020" id="001020" >20</span>
 The wild animals also look up to you longingly, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for the water-courses are dried up, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="chapter" id="002001">2</span> Blow a horn in Zion, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sound an alarm in my holy mountain, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; let all the inhabitants of the land tremble, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for the day of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  comes, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for near is 
<span class="verse" rel="v029002002" id="002002" >2</span>
 the day of darkness and gloom, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the day of cloud and thick darkness! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Like the light of dawn scattered over the mountains, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a people great and powerful; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; its like has not been from of old, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; neither will be any more after it, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; even to the years of coming ages. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v029002003" id="002003" >3</span>
 Before them the fire devours, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and behind them a flame burns; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; like the garden of Eden is the land before them, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and after them it is a desolate desert, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; nothing escapes them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v029002004" id="002004" >4</span>
 Their appearance is as the appearance of horses, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and like horsemen they charge. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v029002005" id="002005" >5</span>
 Like the sound of chariots on the tops of the mountains they leap, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; like the crackle of flames devouring stubble. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; like a mighty people preparing for battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v029002006" id="002006" >6</span>
 Peoples are in anguish before them, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all faces grow pale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v029002007" id="002007" >7</span>
 Like mighty men they run, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; like warriors they mount up a wall, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; they march each by himself, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they break not their ranks, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v029002008" id="002008" >8</span>
 none jostles the other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; They march each in his path. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They fall upon the weapons without breaking. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v029002009" id="002009" >9</span>
 They scour the city, they run on the wall. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They climb up into the houses. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Like a thief they enter the windows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v029002010" id="002010" >10</span>
 Earth trembles before them, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the sky quakes, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; the sun and moon become dark, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the stars withdraw their shining; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v029002011" id="002011" >11</span>
 and the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  utters his voice before his army, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for his host is exceedingly great. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Mighty is he who performs his word. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For great is the day of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; it is terrible, who can endure it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v029002012" id="002012" >12</span>
 But now this is the message of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Turn to me with all your heart, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and with fasting and weeping and mourning, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v029002013" id="002013" >13</span>
 rend your hearts and not your garments, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and turn to the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  your God; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; for he indeed is gracious and merciful, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; slow to anger and plenteous in love, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and relents of the evil. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v029002014" id="002014" >14</span>
 Who knows but he will turn and relent, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and leave a blessing behind him, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a cereal and drink-offering for the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  your God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v029002015" id="002015" >15</span>
 Blow a horn in Zion, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sanctify a fast, summon an assembly, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v029002016" id="002016" >16</span>
 gather the people, make holy the congregation, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; assemble the elders, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; gather the children, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the infants at the breast. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Let the bridegroom come forth from his chamber, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the bride from her bridal tent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v029002017" id="002017" >17</span>
 Between the porch and the altar, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; let the priests, the ministers of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  weep aloud, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; let them say: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spare, the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, your people. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Make not your heritage an object of reproach, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for the heathen to mock them. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why should it be said among the nations, ‘Where is their God?’ </p><h6>Future blessings</h6><p>
<span class="verse" rel="v029002018" id="002018" >18</span>
 Then the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  became deeply concerned for his land, and took pity upon his people, 
<span class="verse" rel="v029002019" id="002019" >19</span>
 and the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  answered and said to his people: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; I will send you grain, wine, and oil. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You will be satisfied. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; I will not make you again <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an object of scorn among the nations, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v029002020" id="002020" >20</span>
 I will remove far from you the northern foe, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and I will drive it into a land barren and desolate, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; its front into the eastern sea, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and its rear to the western sea. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; And from it a stench will arise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; He has done great things! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v029002021" id="002021" >21</span>
 Fear not, land, exult. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rejoice for the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  has done great things! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v029002022" id="002022" >22</span>
 Fear not, animals of the field. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the pastures of the wilderness are putting forth new grass, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; for the trees bear their fruit, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fig-tree and vine yield full harvest. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v029002023" id="002023" >23</span>
 Be glad, then, children of Zion, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and rejoice in the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  your God, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For he has given you the early rain in just measure, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and poured down upon you the winter rain, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and sent the latter rain as before. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v029002024" id="002024" >24</span>
 The threshing floors will be full of grain, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the vats will overflow with new wine and oil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v029002025" id="002025" >25</span>
 I will repay you for the years <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; which the swarming locust has eaten. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The hopping, the destroying, and the cutting locusts, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my great army which I sent among you, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and my people will never again be put to shame. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v029002026" id="002026" >26</span>
 You will eat your food and be satisfied, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and praise the name of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  your God, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; who has dealt so wonderfully by you, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v029002027" id="002027" >27</span>
 and you will know that I am in the midst of Israel, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that I am the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  your God and none else, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and my people will never again be put to shame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v029002028" id="002028" >28</span>
 Afterwards, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will pour out my spirit on everyone. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Your sons and your daughters will prophesy, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; your old men will dream dreams. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Your young men will see visions, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v029002029" id="002029" >29</span>
 and even on your male and female slaves <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; in those days, I will pour out my spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v029002030" id="002030" >30</span>
 And I will show signs in the sky and on earth: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Blood and fire and pillars of smoke. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v029002031" id="002031" >31</span>
 The sun will be turned into darkness, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the moon into blood <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; before the coming of the great and terrible day of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v029002032" id="002032" >32</span>
 But whoever will call upon the name of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  will be saved. For in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem there will be those who escape, even as the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  has said, and among the fugitives those whom the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  calls. <br /><br /><span class="chapter" id="003001">3</span> For, in those days and in that time, when I bring back again the captivity of Judah and Jerusalem, 
<span class="verse" rel="v029003002" id="003002" >2</span>
 I will also gather all the nations and bring them down into the Valley of Jehoshaphat, and there I will enter into judgment with them for my people and my heritage Israel, whom they have scattered among the nations, and divided my land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v029003003" id="003003" >3</span>
 They have cast lots for my people. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; They have traded boys <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for prostitutes, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and sold girls for wine, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and drunk it. <br /><br />
<span class="verse" rel="v029003004" id="003004" >4</span>
 What are you to me, Tyre and Sidon and all the districts of Philistia? Were you repaying any deed of mine, or were you doing something for me? Quickly will I return your deed upon your heads. 
<span class="verse" rel="v029003005" id="003005" >5</span>
 You who have taken my silver and my gold, and you have brought my goodly jewels into your palaces, 
<span class="verse" rel="v029003006" id="003006" >6</span>
 you have sold the people of Judah and of Jerusalem to the Greeks, so that you might remove them far from their own borders. 
<span class="verse" rel="v029003007" id="003007" >7</span>
 I am about to stir them up from the place to which you have sold them, and I will turn your deeds upon your own head. 
<span class="verse" rel="v029003008" id="003008" >8</span>
 I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hands of the people of Judah, and they will sell them to the Sabeans, to a nation far off, for the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  has spoken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v029003009" id="003009" >9</span>
 Proclaim this among the nations, sanctify war. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Arouse the warriors, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; let all the fighting men muster and go up. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v029003010" id="003010" >10</span>
 Beat your ploughshares into swords, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and your pruning-hooks into lances; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; let the weak say, I, indeed, am strong. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v029003011" id="003011" >11</span>
 Bestir yourselves and come, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all you nations round about. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Quickly gather yourselves together, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ask the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  to bring his warriors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v029003012" id="003012" >12</span>
 Let the nations rouse themselves <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and come up to the Valley of Jehoshaphat, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; for there will I sit to judge <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all the surrounding nations. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 Put in the sickle, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for the harvest is ripe; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; go in, tread, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for the wine press is full. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The vats overflow, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for great is their wickedness. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v029003014" id="003014" >14</span>
 Noisy multitudes, noisy multitudes <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the valley of decision <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For near is the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span> ’s day in the valley of decision! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v029003015" id="003015" >15</span>
 Sun and moon have turned dark, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the stars withdrawn their shining. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v029003016" id="003016" >16</span>
 Whenever the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  roars from Zion <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and utters his voice from Jerusalem, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; earth and sky quake; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; but the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  is a refuge to his people, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and a fortress to the people of Israel. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v029003017" id="003017" >17</span>
 And you will know that I am the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  your God, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I who dwells in Zion, my holy mountain, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and Jerusalem will be holy, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and strangers will not pass through her any more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v029003018" id="003018" >18</span>
 In that day, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the mountains will drop sweet wine, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; the hills will flow with milk, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all the channels of Judah will flow with water, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; a fountain will spring from the house of Judah, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and will water the Valley of Shittim. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v029003019" id="003019" >19</span>
 Egypt will become a desolation, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and Edom a wilderness, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; because of the violence done to the people of Judah, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; because they shed innocent blood in their land, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v029003020" id="003020" >20</span>
 Judah will remain inhabited forever, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and Jerusalem from generation to generation. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v029003021" id="003021" >21</span>
 I will avenge their blood which I have not yet avenged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  lives in Zion!
