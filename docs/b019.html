<span class="verse" rel="v019001002" id="001002" >2</span>
 But the law of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  is their joy, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they study it day and night. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019001003" id="001003" >3</span>
 They are like trees <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; planted by runlets of water, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; yielding fruit in due season, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; leaves never fading. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In all that they do, they prosper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019001004" id="001004" >4</span>
 Not so fare the wicked, not so; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; like chaff are they, blown by the wind. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019001005" id="001005" >5</span>
 So the wicked will not stand firm in the judgment, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nor sinners appear, when the righteous are gathered. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019001006" id="001006" >6</span>
 For the way of the righteous is dear to the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but the way of the wicked will end in ruin. </p><h6>Psalm 2 – The Lord’s Chosen King</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="chapter" id="002001">2</span> Why this turmoil of nations, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this futile plotting of peoples, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019002002" id="002002" >2</span>
 with kings of the earth conspiring, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and rulers consulting together, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; against the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  and against his anointed, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019002003" id="002003" >3</span>
 to snap their bonds <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and fling their cords away? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019002004" id="002004" >4</span>
 He whose throne is in heaven laughs, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  mocks them. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019002005" id="002005" >5</span>
 Then he speaks to them in his wrath, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and in his hot anger confounds them. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019002006" id="002006" >6</span>
 “This my king is installed by me, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on Zion my holy mountain.” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019002007" id="002007" >7</span>
 I will tell of the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span> ’s decree. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; He said to me: “You are my son, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this day I became your father. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019002008" id="002008" >8</span>
 Only ask, and I make you the heir of the nations, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and lord of the world to its utmost bounds. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019002009" id="002009" >9</span>
 You will break them with sceptre of iron, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shatter them like pottery.” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019002010" id="002010" >10</span>
 So now, you kings, be wise: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be warned, you rulers of earth. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019002011" id="002011" >11</span>
 Serve the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  in awe, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; kiss his feet with trembling, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019002012" id="002012" >12</span>
 lest, angry, he hurl you to ruin; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for soon will his fury blaze. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Happy all who take refuge in him. </p><h6>Psalm 3 – A Morning Prayer for Protection</h6><p><span class="chapter" id="003001">3</span><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; How many,  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, are my foes! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those who rise up against me are many. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019003002" id="003002" >2</span>
 Many are those who say of me, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “There is no help for him in his God.”   Selah <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019003003" id="003003" >3</span>
 But you,  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, are shield about me, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my glory, who lifts up my head. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019003004" id="003004" >4</span>
 When loudly I call to the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from his holy hill he gives answer.   Selah <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019003005" id="003005" >5</span>
 I laid down and slept: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; now I wake, for the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  sustains me. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019003006" id="003006" >6</span>
 I fear not the myriads of people <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; who beset me on every side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019003007" id="003007" >7</span>
 Arise,  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>: save me, my God, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; who strikes all my foes on the cheek, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and shatters the teeth of the wicked. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019003008" id="003008" >8</span>
 Victory belongs to the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; let your blessing descend on your people.   Selah </p><h6>Psalm 4 – An Evening Prayer</h6><p><span class="chapter" id="004001">4</span><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Answer my cry, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; God, my defender. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Often from straits you have brought me <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to spacious places. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; So now show me your favor <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and hear my prayer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019004002" id="004002" >2</span>
 How long, you proud people, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; will my honor be stained <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; by the slanders you love, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the lies that you follow?   Selah <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019004003" id="004003" >3</span>
 See! The  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  has shown me <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his wonderful kindness: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  hears, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; when I call to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019004004" id="004004" >4</span>
 Sin not in your anger: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but speak in your heart <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on your bed, and be still.   Selah <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019004005" id="004005" >5</span>
 Offer true sacrifice, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; trust in the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019004006" id="004006" >6</span>
 Many are longing <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for fortune to smile. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Lift upon us <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the light of your face. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019004007" id="004007" >7</span>
 You have put in my heart,  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a deeper joy <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; than was theirs who had corn <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and wine in abundance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019004008" id="004008" >8</span>
 So in peace I will <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lie down and sleep; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; for you,  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, keep me <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; safe. </p><h6>Psalm 5 – A Prayer for Guidance</h6><p><span class="chapter" id="005001">5</span><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Hear my words,  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; give heed to my whisper. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019005002" id="005002" >2</span>
 Attend to my loud cry for help, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my king and my God. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019005003" id="005003" >3</span>
 When I pray to you,  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, in the morning, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hear my voice. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; I make ready for you in the morning, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and look for a sign. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019005004" id="005004" >4</span>
 For you are no God who takes pleasure in wickedness: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; no one of evil can be your guest. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019005005" id="005005" >5</span>
 No braggarts can stand in your presence, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you hate all workers of wrong. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019005006" id="005006" >6</span>
 You destroy all speakers of lies, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; people of blood and deceit you abhor. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019005007" id="005007" >7</span>
 But I, through your kindness abundant, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; may enter your house, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and towards the shrine of your temple <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; may reverently bow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019005008" id="005008" >8</span>
 Lead me,  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, in your righteousness <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; because of my enemies. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Make your way level before me. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019005009" id="005009" >9</span>
 For their mouth is a stranger to truth, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; their heart is a pit of destruction. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Their throat is a wide open grave, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; their tongue the smooth tongue of the hypocrite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019005010" id="005010" >10</span>
 Condemn them, God; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; let their schemes bring them down to the ground. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For their numberless crimes thrust them down <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for playing the rebel against you. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019005011" id="005011" >11</span>
 But let all who take refuge in you <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ring out their gladness forever. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Protect those who love your name, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so they may exult in you. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019005012" id="005012" >12</span>
 For you give your blessing,  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, to the godly, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the shield of your favor protects them. </p><h6>Psalm 6 – A Cry for Help in Time of Trouble</h6><p><span class="chapter" id="006001">6</span><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Rebuke me not,  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, in your anger, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; punish me not in your wrath. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

<span class="nd"> Lord</span>, be gracious to me <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in my weakness. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Heal me  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for racked is my body; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019006003" id="006003" >3</span>
 all of me utterly racked. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why do you wait so long,  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019006004" id="006004" >4</span>
 Turn,  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, rescue me; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; save me, because of your love. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019006005" id="006005" >5</span>
 For in death none can call you to mind; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in Sheol who can praise you? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019006006" id="006006" >6</span>
 I am so weary of sighing. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All the night I make my bed swim, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and wet my couch with my tears. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019006007" id="006007" >7</span>
 My eyes swollen with grief; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from weeping caused by my foes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019006008" id="006008" >8</span>
 Begone, workers of wrong, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  has heard my loud weeping, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019006009" id="006009" >9</span>
 the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  has heard my entreaty, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  accepts my prayer. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019006010" id="006010" >10</span>
 My foes will be stricken with terror, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; brought to shame and dismay in a moment. </p><h6>Psalm 7 – A Prayer to the God of Justice</h6><p><span class="chapter" id="007001">7</span><span class="nd"> Lord </span>  about Cush, the Benjamite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="nd"> Lord </span>  my God, I take refuge in you. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Deliver me, save me from all who pursue me; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

 or like lions they will tear me to pieces, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and rend me, past hope of rescue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

<span class="nd"> Lord</span>, my God, if my life has been such <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if my hands have been stained with guilt, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

 if friends I paid back with evil, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if I plundered my foes without cause, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 may the enemy chase and find me, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  trample my life to the ground, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my honor leave in the dirt!   Selah <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019007006" id="007006" >6</span>
 Arise,  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, in anger, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; against my foes rise in fury. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Awake for my help: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; let justice be done. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 For the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  loves justice, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he does not forsake his friends. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The unrighteous will be destroyed forever, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the seed of the wicked will be cut off. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 The wicked watches the righteous, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and seeks to put them to death. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019037033" id="037033" >33</span>
 But the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  leaves them not in their hand: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; at their trial they will not be held guilty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 Wait on the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, and observe his way: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he will lift you to honor the land will be yours, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you will feast your eyes on the doom of the wicked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019037035" id="037035" >35</span>
 I have seen the wicked exultant, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lifting themselves like a cedar of Lebanon. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019037036" id="037036" >36</span>

 My heart is throbbing, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my strength has failed me. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The light of my eyes – <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; even it is gone from me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 They who aim at my life lay their snares, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they who seek my hurt speak of ruin, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nursing treachery all the day long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019038013" id="038013" >13</span>

<span class="verse" rel="v019039002" id="039002" >2</span>
 I was silent and dumb, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; speechless: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but my pain was stirred up. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 My heart grew hot within me; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as I mused, the fire was kindled, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; till at last the words came to my tongue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019039004" id="039004" >4</span>
 “Teach me, O  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>, my end, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the sum of my days what it is. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me know how transient I am. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 See! My days you have made but a span, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and my life is as nothing before you. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; It is but as a breath that everyone stands:   Selah <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

 From the horrible pit he drew me, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; up out of the miry clay; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; he set my feet on a rock, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and my steps he made firm. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019040003" id="040003" >3</span>
 He put a new song in my mouth, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of praise to our God. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Many see it, and, filled with awe, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; put their trust in the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 In offerings bloody or bloodless <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you have no delight, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; but with open ears you have made me. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Burnt-offering and offering for sin <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are not what you ask. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 When one comes to see me, their words ring hollow; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; their heart keeps gathering mischief the while; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and when they go out, they give it speech. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 Insult has broken my heart, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; past cure are my shame and confusion. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; For pity I looked – there was none! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And for comforters, but I found none. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019069021" id="069021" >21</span>
 Poison they gave me for food, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and to slake my thirst they gave vinegar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 But my feet were almost gone, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my steps had nearly slipped, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019073003" id="073003" >3</span>
 through envy of godless braggarts, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; when I saw how well they fared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

 So they wear their pride like a necklace, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they put on the garment of wrong, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019073007" id="073007" >7</span>

<span class="verse" rel="v019073008" id="073008" >8</span>
 Their speech is mocking and evil, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; condescending and crooked their speech. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

<span class="verse" rel="v019073010" id="073010" >10</span>
 Small wonder that people resort to them, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and drink deep draughts of their lore. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

<span class="verse" rel="v019073015" id="073015" >15</span>

 They ate and were more than filled; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he had brought them the thing they desired. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019078030" id="078030" >30</span>
 But the thing they desired became loathsome: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; while their food was still in their mouths, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019078031" id="078031" >31</span>
 the wrath of God rose against them. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He slew the stoutest among them, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and laid low the young men of Israel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019078032" id="078032" >32</span>
 Yet for all this they sinned yet more, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and refused to believe in his wonders. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019078033" id="078033" >33</span>
 So he ended their days in a breath, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and their years in sudden dismay. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019078034" id="078034" >34</span>
 When he slew them, then they sought after him, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they turned and sought God with diligence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019078035" id="078035" >35</span>
 They remembered that God was their rock, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the Most High God their redeemer. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019078036" id="078036" >36</span>
 But they flattered him with their mouth, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and lied to him with their tongue. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019078037" id="078037" >37</span>
 Their heart was not steady with him, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they were faithless to his covenant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019078038" id="078038" >38</span>
 But he is full of pity: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he pardons sin and destroys not. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Often he turns his anger away, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; without stirring his wrath at all. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019078039" id="078039" >39</span>
 So he remembered that they were but flesh, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; breath that passes and does not return. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019078040" id="078040" >40</span>
 But how often they rebelled in the desert, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and caused him grief in the wilderness, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019078041" id="078041" >41</span>
 tempting God again and again, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; provoking the Holy One of Israel. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019078042" id="078042" >42</span>
 They did not remember his strength, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nor the day he redeemed from the foe, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019078043" id="078043" >43</span>
 how he set his signs in Egypt, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the country of Zoan his wonders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019078044" id="078044" >44</span>
 He turned their canals into blood, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; their streams undrinkable. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019078045" id="078045" >45</span>
 He sent forth flies, which devoured them; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; frogs, too, which destroyed them. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019078046" id="078046" >46</span>
 Their crops he gave to the caterpillar, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the fruits of their toil to the locust. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019078047" id="078047" >47</span>
 He slew their vines with hail, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and their sycamore trees with frost. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019078048" id="078048" >48</span>
 He delivered their cattle to the hail, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and their flocks to bolts of fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019078049" id="078049" >49</span>
 He let loose his hot anger among them, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fury and wrath and distress, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a band of destroying angels. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019078050" id="078050" >50</span>
 He cleared a path for his anger, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; did not spare them from death, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but gave them over to pestilence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019078051" id="078051" >51</span>
 He struck down all the first-born in Egypt, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the first fruits of their strength in the tents of Ham. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019078052" id="078052" >52</span>
 He led forth his people like sheep, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he was guide to his flock in the desert. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019078053" id="078053" >53</span>
 Securely he led them, and free from fear, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; while their foes were drowned in the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019078054" id="078054" >54</span>
 To his holy realm he brought them, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to the mountain his right hand had purchased. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019078055" id="078055" >55</span>
 He drove out the nations before them, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and allotted their land for possession, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and their tents for Israel to live in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019078056" id="078056" >56</span>
 Yet they tempted and angered the Most High God, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they did not observe his decrees. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019078057" id="078057" >57</span>
 They drew back, false like their ancestors; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they failed like a treacherous bow. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019078058" id="078058" >58</span>
 Their shrines stirred him to anger, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; their idols moved him to jealousy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019078059" id="078059" >59</span>
 When God heard of this, he was furious, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and he spurned Israel utterly. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019078060" id="078060" >60</span>
 He abandoned his home in Shiloh, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the tent he had pitched among people. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019078061" id="078061" >61</span>
 He gave his strength up to captivity, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his glory to the hands of the foe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019078062" id="078062" >62</span>
 He gave his people to the sword, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he was furious with his own. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019078063" id="078063" >63</span>
 Fire devoured their young men, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and their maidens had no marriage-song. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019078064" id="078064" >64</span>
 Their priests fell by the sword, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and their widows could not weep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019078065" id="078065" >65</span>
 Then the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  awoke as from sleep, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; like a warrior flushed with wine; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019078066" id="078066" >66</span>
 and he beat back his foes, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; putting them to perpetual scorn. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019078067" id="078067" >67</span>
 He disowned the tent of Joseph, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he rejected the tribe of Ephraim; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019078068" id="078068" >68</span>
 but he chose the tribe of Judah, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mount Zion, which he loves. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019078069" id="078069" >69</span>
 And he built like the heights his sanctuary, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; like the earth which he founded forever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019078070" id="078070" >70</span>
 And he chose David his servant, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; taking him from the sheepfolds. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019078071" id="078071" >71</span>
 From the mother-ewes he brought him, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to be shepherd to Jacob his people, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and to Israel his inheritance. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019078072" id="078072" >72</span>
 With upright heart did he shepherd them, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and with skilful hands did he guide them. </p><h6>Psalm 79 – A National Prayer for Deliverance</h6><p><span class="chapter" id="079001">79</span><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Heathen, O God, have come into your land, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; defiling your holy temple, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and laying Jerusalem in ruins. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

<span class="verse" rel="v019105029" id="105029" >29</span>
 He turned their waters into blood, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thus causing their fish to die. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019105030" id="105030" >30</span>
 Their land was alive with frogs, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; swarming even in the royal chambers. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019105031" id="105031" >31</span>
 At his command came flies, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and lice in all their borders. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019105032" id="105032" >32</span>
 He gave them hail for rain <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and fire that flashed through the land, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019105033" id="105033" >33</span>
 smiting their vines and figs, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; breaking the trees of their border. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019105034" id="105034" >34</span>
 At his command came locusts, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; young locusts beyond all counting, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019105035" id="105035" >35</span>
 which ate every herb in the land, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ate up, too, the fruit of their ground. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019105036" id="105036" >36</span>
 He struck down in their land all the first-born, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the firstlings of all their strength <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019105037" id="105037" >37</span>
 Then forth he led Israel with silver and gold, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and among his tribes no one was weary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019105038" id="105038" >38</span>
 Egypt was glad when they left, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for terror had fallen upon them. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019105039" id="105039" >39</span>
 He spread out a cloud to screen them, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and fire to give light in the night. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019105040" id="105040" >40</span>
 He sent quails at their entreaty, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and heavenly bread in abundance. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019105041" id="105041" >41</span>
 He opened the rock; waters gushed: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the desert they ran like a river. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019105042" id="105042" >42</span>
 For he remembered his holy promise <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to Abraham his servant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019105043" id="105043" >43</span>
 So he led out his people with joy, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his elect with a ringing cry. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019105044" id="105044" >44</span>
 And he gave them the lands of the nations, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the fruit of their toil for possession, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019105045" id="105045" >45</span>
 that so they might keep his statutes, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and be of his laws observant. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hallelujah. </p><h6>Psalm 106 – The Nation’s Sin against the Lord</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="chapter" id="106001">106</span> Hallelujah! <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Give thanks to the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  for his goodness, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for his kindness endures forever. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

<span class="verse" rel="v019106005" id="106005" >5</span>
 May I see the good fortune of your elect, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; may I share in the joy of your nation, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and in the pride of your heritage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019106006" id="106006" >6</span>
 We, like our fathers, have sinned, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; we have done perversely and wickedly <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019106007" id="106007" >7</span>
 In the land of Egypt our fathers, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all heedless of your wonders, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and unmindful of your great kindness, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; at the Red Sea defied the Most High. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019106008" id="106008" >8</span>
 But true to his name he saved them, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in order to show his might. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019106009" id="106009" >9</span>
 He rebuked the Red Sea, and it dried; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they marched through the depths as through desert, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019106010" id="106010" >10</span>
 saved from the hand of the hostile, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; redeemed from the hand of the foe. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019106011" id="106011" >11</span>
 The waters covered their enemies: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not one of them was left. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019106012" id="106012" >12</span>
 So then they believed in his words, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and began to sing his praise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019106013" id="106013" >13</span>
 But soon they forgot his deeds: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they did not wait for his counsel. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019106014" id="106014" >14</span>
 Their greed was ravenous in the desert; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they put God to the test in the wilderness. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019106015" id="106015" >15</span>
 He gave them the thing they had asked for, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but sent wasting disease among them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019106016" id="106016" >16</span>
 The camp grew jealous of Moses <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and of Aaron, holy one of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019106017" id="106017" >17</span>
 The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and covered Abiram’s company. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019106018" id="106018" >18</span>
 Fire broke out on their company, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; flame kindled upon the wicked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019106019" id="106019" >19</span>
 They made a calf in Horeb, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and bowed to the molten image. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019106020" id="106020" >20</span>
 They exchanged their glorious God <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for the image of ox that eats grass. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019106021" id="106021" >21</span>
 They forgot the God who had saved them <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by mighty deeds in Egypt <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019106022" id="106022" >22</span>
 Wonders in the land of Ham, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; terrors by the Red Sea. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019106023" id="106023" >23</span>
 So he vowed, and would have destroyed them, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but for Moses his elect, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; who stepped into the breach before him, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to divert his deadly wrath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019106024" id="106024" >24</span>
 They spurned the delightsome land, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they refused to believe in his word. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019106025" id="106025" >25</span>
 They grumbled in their tents, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; would not listen to the voice of the  <span class="nd"> Lord</span>. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019106026" id="106026" >26</span>
 So he swore with uplifted hand <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to lay them low in the wilderness; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019106027" id="106027" >27</span>
 to disperse their seed among heathen, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to scatter them over the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019106028" id="106028" >28</span>
 Then they joined them to Baal of Peor, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and ate what was offered the dead. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019106029" id="106029" >29</span>
 They provoked him to wrath by their deeds, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and plague broke out among them. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019106030" id="106030" >30</span>
 Then Phinehas stood between, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and so the plague was stayed; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019106031" id="106031" >31</span>
 and it was counted to him for righteousness <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unto all generations forever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019106032" id="106032" >32</span>
 They angered him at the waters of Meribah, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; through them it went ill with Moses. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019106033" id="106033" >33</span>
 They rebelled against his spirit, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and he uttered speech that was rash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019106034" id="106034" >34</span>
 They did not destroy the nations, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; as the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span>  had commanded them; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019106035" id="106035" >35</span>
 but they mingled with the heathen, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and learned to do as they did. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019106036" id="106036" >36</span>
 Their idol gods they worshipped, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and they were ensnared by them. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019106037" id="106037" >37</span>
 They sacrificed their sons <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and their daughters to the demons. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019106038" id="106038" >38</span>
 They poured out innocent blood <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; the blood of their sons and daughters <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whom they offered to Canaan’s idols, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and the land was polluted with blood. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019106039" id="106039" >39</span>
 They became unclean by their works, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and adulterous in their deeds. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019106040" id="106040" >40</span>
 Then the  <span class="nd"> Lord </span> ’s fury was on his people, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; filled with horror at his inheritance. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019106041" id="106041" >41</span>
 He delivered them to the heathen, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; to the sway of those who hated them. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019106042" id="106042" >42</span>
 Their enemies oppressed them, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; and subdued them under their hand. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019106043" id="106043" >43</span>
 Many a time he saved them, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; but they rebelled at his counsel, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and were brought low by their wrongdoing. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019106044" id="106044" >44</span>
 Yet he looked upon their distress, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; when he heard their cry. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019106045" id="106045" >45</span>
 He remembered his covenant, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and, in his great kindness, relented. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019106046" id="106046" >46</span>
 He caused them to be pitied <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by all who carried them captive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

<span class="verse" rel="v019107005" id="107005" >5</span>

<span class="verse" rel="v019107011" id="107011" >11</span>

<span class="verse" rel="v019107012" id="107012" >12</span>
 Their heart was bowed with toil; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; there was no one to help when they stumbled. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="verse" rel="v019107013" id="107013" >13</span>
